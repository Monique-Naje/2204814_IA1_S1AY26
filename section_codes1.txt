  <p>When I think of my uncle, I think of my ancestors. He has been there for me in more ways than I can count — from the time I was a baby, through my childhood, teenage years, and now as an adult. My uncle has always shown up for me and my children, no matter how far he travels. His dedication, humor, and humility make him a truly significant figure in my life.</p>

  <p>My favorite quote from my uncle is one that carries deep Jamaican wisdom: <em>“You affi lick arse before you can kick arse.”</em> In essence, he means that before you can succeed or rise to the top, you must first serve, learn, and go through challenges. This quote reminds me to stay grounded and humble, knowing that true success comes after effort and growth.</p>

  <h1><center> <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128184;</span>AI for Fraud Detection and Prevention in Banking<span style='font-size:30px;'>&#129302;</span></center></h1>

  <p>    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way banks identify and prevent fraud. 
    In 2024 alone, the UK lost approximately <strong>£570 million</strong>, 
    and the United States lost nearly <strong>$10 billion</strong> due to payment fraud. 
    These staggering figures highlight why banking institutions are turning to AI as a powerful tool for protection.
  </p>

  <h2>Application in My World</h2>
  <p>AI-powered fraud detection can be used to safeguard online and mobile transactions that people like myself perform daily. 
    As digital banking becomes more common in Jamaica, AI systems can analyze large amounts of financial data in real time 
    to detect unusual activity. This would reduce risks for students, families, and local businesses who rely on online banking for convenience.
  </p>

  <h2>Usefulness</h2>
  <p>The technology helps banks and customers by spotting suspicious transactions early, preventing losses before they occur. 
    It can learn and adapt to new methods that fraudsters use, making it far more effective than traditional rule-based systems. 
    This saves time, builds trust, and strengthens financial stability in the digital economy. </p>

  <h2>Ethical Concerns and Solutions</h2>
  <p>  One ethical concern is the handling of personal data. AI systems must analyze large volumes of customer information, 
    which raises privacy and security issues. Another concern is the possibility of false positives — where legitimate users 
    are wrongly flagged as suspicious. To address these, banks should ensure transparency, use secure encryption, 
    and allow customers to verify flagged transactions easily. Strict adherence to data protection laws and fairness 
    in AI decision-making are also essential.</p>

  <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
  <p>A strong example of AI-driven fraud prevention is 
    <a href="https://www.darktrace.com" target="_blank">Darktrace</a>. 
    This company uses machine learning to detect abnormal patterns in network traffic and financial transactions, 
    alerting users before fraud occurs. Its adaptive learning model continuously improves, 
    keeping pace with evolving cyber threats.  </p>

<h1><center><i>Personal Development — Twelve Pillars (Chapters 4–7)<span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128218;</span></i></center></h1>


<article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 4 — Achieve Your Goals</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> This chapter highlights that setting a goal is not just about achieving grand results but about who you'll become along the way. Michael learns from Charlie that success comes from defining clear goals, writing them down, and taking consistent action. The true reward lies in the personal growth and transformation experienced along the way.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I will begin setting specific academic and personal goals and now make them a apart of mission accomplished tasks—like completing a project—into smaller weekly targets. This method will help me track progress, stay motivated, and enjoy the growth that comes with disciplined goal pursuit.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 5 — The Proper Use of Time</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> Charlie explains that mastering time is essential for success. People must choose discipline over regret focusing on meaningful priorities rather than being controlled by urgency. Without a life goal, one risks living according to someone else’s schedule instead of their own purpose.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I must apply this by creating a daily timetable to balance study, family, and rest. I've decided to dedicate specific hours to coursework and limit distractions like social media. Managing my time wisely will help me stay productive and avoid the regret of wasted opportunities.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 6 — Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> This chapter significantly values the power of environment and association. Charlie tells Michael that the people around us influence our attitudes, structures, habits, and direction in life. We should connect with positive, ambitious, and supportive individuals who lift us higher as we grow.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I will evaluate my friendships and spend more time with people who inspire growth—such as mentors, classmates, and faith-based groups. I’ll also distance myself from negative influences and seek new connections that align with my goals and values.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 7 — Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> Charlie teaches that while formal education builds a foundation, self-education creates lasting success. Reading, observing successful people, and reflecting on experiences are vital to continuous improvement. Lifelong learning keeps the mind sharp and the spirit growing.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I plan to make learning a daily habit by reading books, watching educational videos, and engaging in online courses about computing and leadership. I’ll also reflect weekly on what I’ve learned to apply it in practical ways that helps me stay adaptable and inspired in all areas of life.</p>
