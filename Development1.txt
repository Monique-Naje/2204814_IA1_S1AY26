<h1><center><i>Personal Development — Twelve Pillars (Chapters 4–7)<span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128218;</span></i></center></h1>


<article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 4 — Achieve Your Goals</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> This chapter highlights that setting a goal is not just about achieving grand results but about who you'll become along the way. Michael learns from Charlie that success comes from defining clear goals, writing them down, and taking consistent action. The true reward lies in the personal growth and transformation experienced along the way.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I will begin setting specific academic and personal goals and now make them a part of mission accomplished tasks—like completing a project—into smaller weekly targets. This method will help me track my progress, stay motivated, and enjoy the growth that comes with pursuing disciplined goals.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 5 — The Proper Use of Time</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> Charlie explains that mastering time is essential for success. People must choose discipline over regret, focusing on meaningful priorities rather than being controlled by urgency. Without a life goal, one risks living according to someone else’s schedule instead of one's own purpose.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I must apply this by creating a daily timetable to balance study, family, and rest. I've decided to dedicate specific hours to coursework and limit distractions. Managing my time wisely will help me stay productive and avoid the regret of wasted opportunities.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 6 — Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> This chapter significantly values the power of environment and association. Charlie tells Michael that the people around us influence our attitudes, structures, habits, and direction in life. We should connect with positive, ambitious, and supportive individuals who lift us higher as we grow.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I will evaluate my friendships and spend more time with people who inspire growth—such as mentors, classmates, and faith-based groups. I’ll also distance myself from negative influences and seek new connections that align with my goals and values.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="pillar">
    <h3>Chapter 7 — Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
    <p><em>Summary:</em> Charlie teaches that while formal education builds a foundation, self-education creates lasting success. Reading, observing successful people, and reflecting on experiences are vital to continuous improvement. Lifelong learning keeps the mind sharp and the spirit growing.</p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> I plan to make learning a daily habit by reading books, watching educational videos, and engaging in online courses about computing and leadership. I’ll also reflect weekly on what I’ve learned to apply it in practical ways that help me stay adaptable and inspired in all areas of life.</p>
